> 1. What is Spatial Locality and why does it benefit performance?

Spatial locality is kind of like checking out all the books in the library having to do with programming and taking them home and putting them all on a shelf or in a pile.  Every time you need to look something up, pulling out a book from a pile or a shelf is a lot faster than having to go back to the library to check out a different programming book to look something up.  As far as performance, it's a lot faster look up something that's all together than it is to have to drive somewhere to get it or to do another query on the RAM.
