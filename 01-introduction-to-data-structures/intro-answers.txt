Line
"1. How does your data structure allow developers to access and manipulate the data?"
The line is built on an array (self.members = []) which allows a developer to add with the join() function to the line or allow one to be removed with leave().

"2. If a developer wanted to find a specific element in your data structure, how would you search for it?"
A developer would use the search() function and if that search found something, a value would be returned.

"3. What other real-world data can each structure represent?"
If built out with more complexity, it could be used by a ride-sharing application for people that want to wait in a line to pickup people at a stadium or airport.

"1. How does your data structure allow developers to access and manipulate the data?"
A developer would access this data through the two dimensional array named matrix. They would manipulate the data with the use of the insert() function.

"2. If a developer wanted to find a specific element in your data structure, how would you search for it?"
A developer would have to search through the matrix 2 dimensional (x and y) array to perform a search.

"3. What other real-world data can each structure represent?"
Without getting too complicated, this could be used for an electronic game of Battleship, chess or checkers etc.
